# VR-Endless-Runner
VR endless runner type game for google cardboard uses a game controller for input
This project was created in unity version 5.6.0f3(64 bit) using gvr sdk version 0.6.
Currently this game has only 3 inputs going left, going right and reset. The input can be given by any kind of external 
controller, I tried with cosmicByte game pad.
The difficulty and the rate at which the player scores points changes increases with after every 10 points gained by the player.
There are 4 types of bridge prefabs which spawn in a random order, taking care that no 2 consecutive prefabs are the same.
Only 7 pieces of bridge are present at any give time to prevent memory overflow.
